1. Cleaning a certain dataset is an example of a task that automation can be used in. Due to the addition of new data, a clean dataset may become unclean. An automatd script to clean the dataset right after data is added can help make sure the data is alway clean without any human intervention. Updating software is another example automation can be used in since updating software or a system version often requires human intervention. This leaves time in between where a new update is released and when the system or software is updated. This time may leave the system/software vulnerable, making automation very useful here.

2. When automation tasks are poorly managed, they have a huge impact on end result of the automation and the people dependent on it. For example, a certain automation task is to backup critical files in the case of a system failure. In between, a user changes the directory where files are stored but they did not update the new location in the automation task. So, the automation task backups up an old directory where no new files have been saved. If the system fails or breaks and the user attempts to restore the system using the backup, the user will find out that only old files have been saved and new files have not. This would cause the user to permanently loose files that could have had critical information. Therefore, it is crucial that automated tasks are manged properly as many essntial functions may be supported by them and people maybe dependent on them to function properly. Ways these risks can be avoided are through perodically checking if tasks are functioning properly and making apropriate changes to a task if a certain part is impacted.
