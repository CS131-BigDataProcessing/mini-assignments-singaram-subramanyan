This directory has two files: preprocessing.sh and about_script.txt. The preprocessing.sh file is a script that conducts 3 tasks to preprocess the data. The about_script.txt file explains whats done in each part of the script and why these decisions were made. In order to implement the script simply run the script in terminal using the sh preprocessing.sh command however, please make sure the AB_NYC_2019.csv file is downloaded and accessible.
